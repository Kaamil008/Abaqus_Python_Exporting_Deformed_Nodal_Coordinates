# Abaqus_Python_Exporting_Deformed_Nodal_Coordinates
This Script extracts the original and deformed coordinated of selected nodes from the odb model. 1. the Results.txt file is in append mode so once after generating it if you run the script again, it append below again. 2. if using for different odb and diffrent nodes, just change the file name and node_ids in the code.
